Create a general function that simulates the force of gravity from both galactic centers on any given star and calculates the resulting movement. Keep track of each stars position and their new positions. Create a function for the motion of the second galactic center reletive to the first and make it fully customizable (initial position, initial velocity, initial acceleration(?), etc.)."
