    "As we can see, when I try to apply the odeint function to the stars in a galaxy, the results we get do not match what we expect. I suspect the problem arises in one of my conversions. I start out this notebook with a function that defines stars using polar coordinates, but the equations we were given are not compatible with them. I did not have the proper knowledge to convert them to polar, so I had to convert my position information back to cartesian as I looped through each star. This lead to a lot of extra mathematical bagage (for example, defining the x_loc, x_vel, etc. variables) and though I went over them multiple times I am faily certain I was simply unable to correctly account for that conversion."
